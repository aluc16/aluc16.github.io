I am an MSc student studying glaciology and oceanography in the Earth Sciences department at the University of Oregon. My research interests include sediment interactions at tidewater glaciers, numerical modeling of the cryosphere, and lake-terminating glaciers. I am advised by Dave Sutherland.

In 2024, I finished my BS in environmental science with minors in math and geology at Appalachian State University. My undergraduate thesis is titled "Modeling the Role of Frontal Ablation in the 21st Century Evolution of Lake-Terminating Glaciers on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska, USA".
